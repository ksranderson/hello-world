Just another repository

So, this is Reuben and it is a little bizarre living in a Covid-19 world but hello there, are you listening?  Haha.

Here is an update, it's January 11, 2022 and Covid-19 has not gone away.  It is a cold the world can't shake!  So, now we are about to embark on two projects which will require time in the lab.  These MOOC courses will start to degrade in the time I put into them from a 2020 level of 100% to probably 10-20% of my time.  However, things change so we'll see.
